# Data Intelligence Application Project - Davide Rutigliano (A.Y. 2018/2019)

In this repository we provide two ipython notebook (togheter markdown and code) from google colab.

We choose to study part 1 and part 3 of the course, respectively: [Pricing](https://github.com/DavideRutigliano/Data-Intelligence-Application/blob/master/Pricing.ipynb) and [Advertising](https://github.com/DavideRutigliano/Data-Intelligence-Application/blob/master/Advertising.ipynb).

## Topic 1: Pricing

You can access the notebook either via github or via colab directly using the link to the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z1E7maW8z6TSad0rM8PJzaC07dEELBck) on colab, with read only permissions.

In the notebook you can find the basic version of the experiment. For modifying the code (setting version and verbosity) you can  open it on colab as a guest.

## Topic 2: Advertising
